# Django-learning-progress
In this repository I will document my progress while I learn to develop web applications with Django!

<h3>Lesson 1</h1>
<p>In this lesson, I studied the basics for the setup and configuration of a small static web page</p>

<h3>Lesson 2</h1>
<p>In this lesson, I was able to understand templates and apps (at least the essential stuff)</p>

<h3>Lesson 3</h1>
<p>I am developing a small poll aplication that takes input and stores it on a database, 
  I can't show the commands that I have to run for the models to migrate, but you can find all about 
it in the official <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/databases/">Django documentation</a>.</p>
